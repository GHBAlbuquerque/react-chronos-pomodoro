          <p>
            Oops! It looks like the page you’re trying to access doesn’t exist.
            Maybe it went on vacation, decided to explore the universe, or got
            lost somewhere between two black holes. 🌌
          </p>
          <p>
            But don’t worry, you’re not lost in space (yet). You can safely
            return to the <RouterLink href='/'>main page</RouterLink> or{' '}
            <RouterLink href='/history'>history</RouterLink> — or you can stay
            here and pretend you found RouterLink secret page that only the
            coolest explorers can access. 🧭✨
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think this page should exist (or if you want to chat about
            time travel and wormholes), just get in touch. Otherwise, use the
            menu to return to the real world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, here’s something to ponder: “If RouterLink page doesn’t
            exist on the internet, did it ever really exist?” 🤔💭
